Load external JS/CSS files
==========================
 * Allows you to specify a list of external JS/CSS files to load from e.g. another server.
 * Doing this in 8.0 is a lot simpler than in 7.0, now you just need to extend a template with the necessary **link** and **script** tags.

**Note:** The original purpose of this branch was to add CSS to an Odoo website - you will probably want to edit the module dependencies to better suit your own use
